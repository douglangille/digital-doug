We ain’t special here. Nearly every organization is pretty much right with us. Go ahead and play with all the tools– just be mindful of your data privacy and that of others.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve also been playing around with a couple other models and interfaces that have longer input windows (how much text you can feed it in a prompt):</p><ul><li><p>Microsoft Copilot with a personal account is fast with GPT 3.5/4 has a 2000/4000 character input window depending on the model (tone).</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Copilot Notebook has an 18000 character window in an editable frame for iterating prompts. I use this a lot. It’s beta and not everyone has access.&nbsp;<a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/?showntbk=1">https://copilot.microsoft.com/?showntbk=1</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>OpenAI’s ChatGPT is really fast but with GPT 3.5 but not very creative. It has an 8000 token limit for input. Paid plans are 32000.&nbsp;<a href="https://chat.openai.com/">https://chat.openai.com</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Google Gemini has about a million token input window which will likely make this a non-issue as the other models follow suit.&nbsp;<a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">https://gemini.google.com/app</a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Anthropic Claude v3 has a 200K token limit, but they throttle the frequency of usage. Which is fine. Very creative.&nbsp;<a href="https://claude.ai/chats">https://claude.ai/chats</a>.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Google NotebookLM (US only, requires a VPN) has a real interesting approach for working with multiple sources you provide as context. Kinda like a personal LLM. I’ll talk about that separately when it is formally unleashed in Canada.&nbsp;<a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">https://notebooklm.google.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>BTW: A token is approximately 4 characters, ¾ a word. 100 tokens is approximately 75 words.</p><p>Okay, so most folks have been dabbling with simple prompts, using it the same way as you use a search engine. Ask a few follow-up questions and you can hammer out a result.</p><p>You can do better tho. I’ll save you some Googling.</p><h2>The Anatomy of a Good Prompt</h2><p>Basically, a good prompt has 6 components and it looks like this:</p><p>Persona&nbsp;+&nbsp;Context&nbsp;+&nbsp;Task&nbsp;+&nbsp;Exemplar&nbsp;+&nbsp;Format&nbsp;+&nbsp;Tone</p><ul><li><p>Task&nbsp;is mandatory (obviously).</p></li><li><p>Context&nbsp;and&nbsp;Exemplars&nbsp;are important.</p></li><li><p>Persona,&nbsp;Format&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tone&nbsp;are nice-to-haves.</p></li></ul><p>You are an expert in technology innovation and development in higher education.&nbsp;I am an experienced IT leader within Digital Innovation &amp; Technology at the Nova Scotia Community College and want to provide innovative solutions to increase student, staff and faculty engagement with modern technology.&nbsp;Brainstorm ten detailed ideas to pitch to academic leaders using the 10X Thinking framework to flesh out each idea in detail.&nbsp;Output it as a business position paper,&nbsp;complete with an executive summary at the beginning and a list of cited references at the end.&nbsp;Use professional business language and a neutral tone, using third person and limited jargon.</p><p>NOTE: You can have a lot of fun with tone… “Now rewrite this in the voice of Dr Gregory House.”</p><h2>Have Better Conversations with the Robots</h2><p>As many of you know, I love me a scheming partner to bounce ideas off. This is a kind of reverse prompt where the LLM prompts me to help me think through challenges and ideas.</p><p><em>You are an experienced coach and mentor with expertise in emerging technologies field and in higher education. You are very familiar with the Nova Scotia Community College, its mission/values and its programs. Your goal is to help me refine my thinking and develop strategies in leading innovation and change for staff, students and faculty at the College. I want you to end each response with a probing question. Do you understand?</em></p><p>Short post today folks. Hope these help spark your imagination.
