Why <em>was</em> I late? Did it even matter? I was here now. That was what was important. That’s all. <em>Are you sure about that?</em></p><p>The nurse’s gloved hand crossed my field of vision. With a damp cloth, she wiped Jenny’s brow.</p><p>“I’m here now,” I said and grabbed her hand. She squeeze hard, her whole body stiffening. It was getting close now.</p><p>A break in the pain. Jenny pressed her question. “What was so fucking important that you couldn’t be here? I called and called. I needed you.”</p><p>I couldn’t tell her. Not now. Not here. Not like this. <em>Chicken shit.</em></p><p>People, so many people. Doctors, nurses, orderlies. Beeping. Laughter in the hallway. The sound cut through me. I wanted to yell. I want to scream for everyone to stop and go away.</p><p>“Had to go to the office. Pick up a few files while I was off.” There it was. Another lie. A slippery slope.</p><p>“You just had to see her, didn’t you?” She was yelling as another wave hit. Voices behind me talking about dilation and complications. Time was getting short.</p><p>Was it easier to let her think that? No. The affair was a mistake. And it was over. Almost three months now. <em>Bullshit. Even if Mia wasn’t there today, you would have stumbled, wouldn’t you? Coward.</em></p><p>“She wasn’t there. Just Gary.” That wasn’t true. Her eyes were wide with distrust.</p><p>“He called me in.” Also not true. She hated me.</p><p>“Said he had an at-home project for me.” Not even close. Another lie. <em>Deeper and deeper.</em></p><p>“You can’t even focus on our family for a single moment.” Her accusation stung, spat out with venom. <em>Can you blame her?</em></p><p>“You’ll have to leave now, sir.” A male voice. “We have to take her.”</p><p>I stood there dumbstruck, not comprehending the doctor. The words didn’t make sense. I was nudged aside and almost fell.</p><p>“I love you, Brian. But I hate you too”, she said as they wheeled her away.</p><p>I ran after the gurney, kissed her forehead. “I’m sorry.” <em>You have no idea.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>I’m at Jenny’s grave holding Benny. He’s getting so big. So quick. The car horn rings out and breaks my sombre reverie.</p><p>Juggling the six-month-old on one hip, I bend and place a small bouquet of daffodils on the marker. Benny touches my wet face as I stand up.</p><p>Back at the car, Mia is in the passenger seat, window rolled down and she’s sweating in the way that only a pregnant woman can.</p><p>“It’s time,” Mia says.</p><p>I tuck Benny in his seat and we leave for the hospital.</p><p>Post navigation</p>
