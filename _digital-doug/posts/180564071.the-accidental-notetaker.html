Making sense of them later? That’s the part that always broke me. I’m lying. Taking notes hurts my soul. I kinda hate it and telling myself to <em>embrace the suck</em> is not helpful.</p><p>I’ve tried everything: elaborate systems, minimalist systems, digital, analog, hybrid. Most collapsed under their own weight. The ones that didn’t still left me with a pile of fragments I never had the energy to reassemble.</p><p><em>So many Moleskins. So much illegible scrawl. My handwriting has a very short best before date for interpretation. If you know, you know.</em></p><p>Then, almost by accident, I stumbled on a workflow that actually worked. It wasn’t a new app, a revolutionary framework, or a productivity guru’s manifesto. It was a perspective shift in when and how I made sense of what I captured.</p><p>Here’s how it happened.</p><h2><strong>The Struggle Bus of Good Intentions</strong></h2><p>For years, my note-taking was a mess. In meetings, I’d scribble in notebooks, type furiously in OneNote, or worse, try to structure things in real time and miss half the conversation. I’d walk out with pages of half-formed thoughts, more bullets than a John Wick movie, and arrows pointing God knows where. Worse was the sinking feeling that I’d just wasted an hour. I would never revisit the notes because they had no long-tail meaning.</p><p>I tried <em>everything</em>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Apple Notes: The Comfortable Junk Drawer</strong><br>For a long time, this was my default. It still is. Fast, everywhere, Siri-friendly. A beautiful, searchable paradox, full of insights I could never find when I needed them. No structure, no guilt. Just… stuff. It scaled into chaos, not clarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Forever Notes Framework</strong><br>I’m not alone. About a year ago, Matthias Hilse came up with a framework to tame Apple Notes for him and <a href="https://www.myforevernotes.com/">shared it here</a>. I admire the idea: atomic notes, linked thinking, a personal knowledge garden. The perpetual journal thing is chef’s kiss. It’s essentially a digital <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>. I tried. I really did. But it demands more upkeep than I can sustain. During busy stretches, it collapses into another graveyard of broken promises. I’m still using it for weekly and quarterly planning. That’s working well. <em>Take what resonates and discard the rest.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Obsidian: The Fiddly Era Redux</strong><br>Plugins, backlinks, constant refactoring. It was like owning a high-maintenance sports car, I spent more time tuning it than driving it. Eventually, the friction outweighed the benefits. The two happiest days in a Jag owner’s life? The day they buy the car and the day they sell it. Obsidian is kinda like that. I promise to not try it again. Probably. <a href="https://obsidian.md">You can check out Obsidian here.</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Plain Text (VS Code + Git)</strong><br>This is my writing studio. Solid, calm, durable. Version control without ceremony. I’ve always loved it for both blogging and long-form work. A folder tree brimming with simple text files has been with me for decades. But plain text isn’t built for meetings. It’s great for capture, terrible for sense-making. You cannot simultaneously listen to budget explanations and type out intricate markdown headers. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> is a great text editor. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a great place to keep your files safe, but not for everyone. Any cloud solution and backup strategy will do the job.</p></li><li><p><strong>OneNote</strong><br>A sprawling, multi-layered maze that required more mental energy to organize than it returned. I use this for work by default because we’re a Microsoft shop and a bunch of people share OneNote notebooks. It integrates with the entire Office suite and I’m told it’s amazeballs by its adherents. I don’t see it. Not for me anyway. Something about floating textboxes on an infinite white canvas damages my calm. I have notes and notebooks in sections and pages everywhere. It’s horrid. And I hate it. <a href="https://onenote.cloud.microsoft/">OneNote</a> is free for personal use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plaintext Productivity as a Philosophy</strong> <br>I love me all the low-friction tools and open formats. Michael Descy has put together the best approach I’ve seen with <a href="https://plaintext-productivity.net/">Plaintext Productivity</a>. But even plain text doesn’t solve the core problem: <em>I could capture everything and still understand nothing.</em> Plaintext and markdown are language, but they are not tools.</p></li></ul><p>So I kept searching.</p><h2><strong>Spoiler Alert! An AI Workflow</strong></h2><p>A few months ago, I was testing <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Copilot</a> for something unrelated. On a whim, I opened it during a meeting and typed:</p><pre><code>I’m in a meeting. Don’t respond unless I ask you to. Just capture facts, ideas, and actions as I share them.</code></pre><p>No structure. No formatting. Just raw fragments.</p><p>I didn’t have to think about where to put things. I didn’t have to fight with bullet points or indentation. I just listened and talked in the meeting, tapped a few words, and stayed present.</p><p>Unlike paper, I didn’t have to retype anything later.</p><p>Unlike OneNote, I didn’t have to organize anything in real time.</p><p>It was the first time I’d ever captured notes <em>without</em> feeling like I was failing at note-taking.</p><p>Side note. You don’t have to do this in the chatbot live. Half the time, I just tapped into Notepad or an Apple Note. Doesn’t matter. Just capture the scraps.</p><h2><strong>The Sense-Making Pipeline</strong></h2><p>Here’s where the magic happened, not during the meeting, but <em>after</em>.</p><h3><strong>Phase 1: Neutral Gap Review</strong></h3><p>If needed, I copy/paste the raw notes into a clean chat. At the bottom of the capture, I say to Copilot:</p><pre><code>Here’s what I captured. Identify gaps or unclear points, but don’t invent meaning. Ask me smart one at a time questions to fill in the blanks.</code></pre><p>It would flag missing context, ambiguous phrases, or places where my shorthand was too cryptic. No hallucinations, no assumptions, just a neutral review. It would ask <em>me</em> to clarify when needed. Extract the stuff I heard but didn’t jot down.</p><p>What’s weird, is that I didn’t need a copy of the meeting transcript to do this.</p><h3><strong>Phase 2: Interrogate and Interview</strong></h3><p>This was the game-changer.</p><p>Instead of staring at a wall of text, I’d ask Copilot:</p><pre><code>What’s the most important decision we made?
What are the open questions?
What’s one thing I might have missed?</code></pre><p>It forced me to clarify my own thinking, one piece at a time. No overwhelm, no rabbit holes, just a structured conversation that surfaced blind spots I’d glossed over.</p><h3><strong>Phase 3: Optional Riffing</strong></h3><p>If I had bandwidth, time or a niggling interest that would not quiet, I’d ask:</p><pre><code><code>What’s a creative way to approach [X]?</code>
<code>How might this connect to [Y]?</code></code></pre><p>This isn’t about AI generating ideas for me. I use it as a sounding board to explore my own thoughts.</p><h3><strong>Phase 4: The Roll-Up Summary</strong></h3><p>Once I’d clarified the key points, I’ll ask for a clean summary:</p><pre><code>Give me a structured recap: decisions, actions, open questions.</code></pre><p>No fluff, no filler. Just a distilled version of what actually mattered.</p><h3><strong>Phase 5: Publish to Loop</strong></h3><p>It’s a trivial button click to push the output to a <a href="https://loop.cloud.microsoft">Microsoft Loop</a> page, title it with the date and topic, and drop it into the appropriate workspace. No admin, no restructuring. Just a modular, shareable artifact.</p><h2><strong>Why This Actually Works</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Light Capture Preserves Presence</strong></h3><p>I don’t fight note structure during meetings anymore. I just capture raw material.</p><h3><strong>2. Sense-Making Happens</strong></h3><p>Post-meeting, when I have bandwidth, AI acts as a facilitator (not a replacement) for thinking. By shifting the organization and clarification effort to the post-meeting window, I utilize my available cognitive bandwidth.</p><h3>3. Facilitated Thinking Wins</h3><p>The one-question-at-a-time model surfaces gaps I’d otherwise miss. Facilitated thinking beats solo note cleanup. <em>That’s it. That’s the tweet.</em> Every time.</p><h3><strong>4. Fits My Existing Systems</strong></h3><p>The fragments map naturally to any existing setup. No new frameworks, no extra steps. You can even dump it all into OneNote, <em>you monsters</em>.</p><h3><strong>5. Loop Finally Makes Sense</strong></h3><p>It’s content-centric, not document-centric. Notes become modular, live objects—not static files gathering digital dust. Yeah, I think I’m starting to finally understand the paradigm shift Loop represents. <em>All the <a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a> users can slow-clap now.</em></p><h2><strong>Who This Is For</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>As a general rule, don’t put sensitive or confidential info into AI.</strong> This is for personal sense-making, not classified discussions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Works for:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Faculty: curriculum planning, research discussions.</p></li><li><p>Students: clarifying lecture notes, brainstorming.</p></li><li><p>Anyone who’s tired of staring at a wall of text and wondering, <em>“What was I even thinking?”</em></p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>This complements, not replaces, official notes.</strong> Use it alongside Teams Notes or meeting minutes.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Less Guilt, More Clarity</strong></h2><p>I don’t dread reviewing my notes anymore. I don’t feel guilty about abandoned systems. I’m not “taking notes”. I’m co-authoring clarity with a tool that asks better questions than I do on my own.</p><p>It’s not perfect. It’s not for every situation. But for the first time in years, my note-taking system aligns with how I actually think. <em>Thankee sai.</em></p><h2><strong>The Open Experiment</strong></h2><p>I’m still exploring this. Testing reverse-conversation patterns, tweaking the prompts, seeing what else sticks.</p><p>If you’ve struggled with note-taking, try this for <em>one</em> meeting this week. See what happens. You might be surprised. I was.</p><p><strong>Do your future self a solid: one meeting, one workflow, zero chaos.</strong></p>
