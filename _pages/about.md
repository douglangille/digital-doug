I'm Doug Langille, an IT leader at Nova Scotia Community College where I spend my days trying to convince people that yes, AI is actually useful, and no, it won't write your strategic plan for you (I've tried).

This site is where I document the experiments, share the failures, and occasionally admit when something actually works.

## What You'll Get Here

Weekly dispatches from the trenches:
- **AI integration** – Mistral, Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, NotebookLM, Gemini, and Microsoft 365 Copilot. I'm testing everything because apparently I hate simplicity.
- **Productivity systems** – How I organize chaos using markdown, GitHub, and VSCode while maintaining a plaintext-first philosophy
- **Higher education innovation** – What actually happens when you try to implement change in institutional environments
- **Digital craftsmanship** – Philosophy of making things that last

I publish weekly except when I don't (holidays, existential crises, etc.).

## Who This Is For

You're probably an educator, IT person, or innovation advocate who's sick of LinkedIn thought leadership and wants to know what actually happens when someone tries to implement all this stuff.

You appreciate honesty over inspiration. You'd rather hear "here's how I broke it three times before it worked" than "5 transformational frameworks for synergistic excellence."

If you want a guru, keep scrolling. If you want someone figuring this out beside you, pull up a chair.

## Fair Warning

This is explicitly labeled as brain-droppings for a reason:
- The workbench is messy
- The AI toolkit is excessive
- The plaintext obsession is real (markdown everything, fight me)
- The self-awareness is borderline debilitating

You've been warned.

## Beyond This Site

I also write fiction at [On a Darkling Whim](https://douglangille.ca/) where the dark stuff gets blamed on "creative expression" instead of "concerning personality traits."

Two completely separate worlds. This one has coffee; that one has whiskey.
