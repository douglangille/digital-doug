I'm Doug Langille, an IT leader at Nova Scotia Community College where I spend my days navigating AI integration, institutional change, and the eternal question: "Can we just use Excel for this?"

This site documents the experiments, the failures, and the occasional wins from someone actually implementing all the stuff LinkedIn gurus talk about.

## What You'll Find Here

Weekly articles on:
- **AI in practice** – What works, what breaks, what's worth your time
- **Productivity systems** – Plaintext workflows, knowledge management, digital craftsmanship
- **Higher education innovation** – Implementing change in institutional environments
- **Honest post-mortems** – How I broke it three times before it worked

Published every week except when I don't (holidays, existential crises, etc.).

## Who This Is For

You're an educator, IT person, or innovation advocate who:
- Is sick of thought leadership theater
- Wants to know what actually happens when rubber meets road
- Prefers "here's what failed" over "5 transformational frameworks"

If you want a guru, keep scrolling. If you want someone figuring this out beside you, stick around.

## Fair Warning

This is explicitly labeled as brain-droppings:
- The workbench is messy
- The takes are lukewarm
- The self-awareness is debilitating
- The markdown obsession is real (fight me)

You've been warned.

## Beyond This Site

I also write dark fiction at [On a Darkling Whim](https://douglangille.ca/). Two separate worlds. This one has coffee; that one has whiskey.
