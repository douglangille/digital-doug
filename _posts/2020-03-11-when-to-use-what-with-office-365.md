As I mentioned two weeks ago, I was challenged with creating an infographic.

I double-downed on said challenge and opted to do it with Office 365’s built-in tools.

I doubled again and decided to use PowerPoint.

I’m pretty satisfied with the result with the caveat that crafting this kind of thing is definitely not in my wheelhouse.

Below is the result. Also in PDF. It’s sized for 11×17 so if you print it, you’ll have to adjust your print settings accordingly. [Download it here.](https://douglangille.ca/assets/images/W2UW_43491.pdf)

But you really shouldn’t print. ***Please think of the kittens.***
