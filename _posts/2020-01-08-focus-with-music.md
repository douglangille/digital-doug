**“Okay, it’s time to work now.”**

Ten minutes later…

“I wonder what’s happening on Facebook…?”

We’ve become quite busy in our lives with all the beeps and blips of modern life. We’re driven to get as much done as possible in the shortest amount of time. We squeeze as much as possible into each waking moment. Folks pride themselves on their ability to multitask. Gotta get things done. Right meow.

> Ya can’t walk and chew gum.  
> And you shouldn’t text and drive.

Multitasking is a myth– I’m pretty sure you’ve heard this by now. The more tasks we try to do at once, the more time we spend switching between them than actually doing them.

**It’s madness.**

If only we could focus– really focus– on one thing at a time, we’d do a much better job.

So we follow all the good advice so we can get to working or creating or studying or whatever.

Turn off the TV. Turn off the phone. Turn off the Internet.

**But how do you turn off your brain?**

We’ve become so accustomed to constant input and activity, that to stop and just do that ONE THING is nearly impossible.

Our minds wander. Our thoughts race. We get anxious. We check in with the world– Facebook, the news, the phone… the fridge.

But, every once in a while, you do it. Right?

You get **IN THE ZONE.**

Ah, the Zone. It’s a wonderful place where the sense of time evaporates and all that matters is the work. Hours later, the spell is broken and you’ve made progress. Your back hurts and you’re kinda hungry, but you’re high on accomplishment.

Aaannndddd…. you can never seem to get that that magical focus again. You can’t call upon it on command. It’s a roll of the dice and a spin of the wheel.

But. What if I told you it was possible to induce this state of [FLOW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))?

[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) figured this out 30 years ago. Here’s a [fascinating TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow) by this guy.

**120 Beats Per Minute**

Runners and athletes have learned that training to music at a tempo between 120 and 150 beats per minute can make significant differences. They can train harder and longer. They can sharpen their skills and focus.

Behaviorists and psychologists, looking to help persons with ADHD, Asperger’s and/or related conditions, have figured out that music at a similar tempo improves focus, performance, and ability.

Mediation experts eager to help people improve their working focus have come across this as well.

Video game designers have figured it out too. 120 bmp soundtracks keep players focused and immersed in the game.

Casinos have this figured out too. #jussayin

**Listening to music to help you work is nothing new.**

You can increase the odds of entering a flow state:

- playlists should have an average tempo of between 120 and 150 bpm
- tracks should have minimal lyrics (none is better)

There are some great free playlists at [musicForProgramming](http://musicforprogramming.net/?about).

Google Play Music and Spotify both have playlists for focusing.

Google or search YouTube for “120 BPM” and you’ll get some jams. Some of my favorites include music from the [Donkey Kong Country](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donkey+kong+country+music) game series and [Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=zelda+breath+of+the+wild+music).

**Takeaway?**

Listen to some playlists to melt away time and amp up the productivity. If you have any other cool playlists, shout out in the comments.
