I’m always on the lookout for tools and technologies that can help our teams be more productive, focused, and effective in our work. A couple weeks ago, my amazing wife found this on the interwebs and excitedly had to share it with me. Because she’s the most inspiring person I know, I gave it a spin. It’s an incredible suite of AI-powered applications called Goblin Tools, and I just had to share my thoughts with y’all.

What makes Goblin Tools so special, you ask? In short, it’s bringing the power of large language models (LLMs) to tackle the unique challenges that neurodivergent knowledge workers often face. I’ll admit, I was a bit skeptical. After all, aren’t AI tools supposed to be impersonal and rigid?

The team behind Goblin Tools has done an amazing job of creating a suite of tiny applications that are not only incredibly useful, but also genuinely fun to use. Take their Magic ToDo tool, for example. I’ve tried just about every to-do list app under the sun. But Magic ToDo is something kinda special. When I’m overwhelmed and have to brain-dump my tasks to get them out of my head so I can think, this fits the bill.

[![](/assets/images/some-goblins-are-kinda-cute/34f2811c-ecdb-45b7-a971-12e376fb41fa_1024x994.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1frl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34f2811c-ecdb-45b7-a971-12e376fb41fa_1024x994.png)

Rather than forcing me to meticulously organize my tasks, the AI-powered assistant actually helps me to articulate my thoughts and priorities. Crank them in using natural language and drill down as often as needed. The end result? I’m able to get a clear picture of what I need to accomplish, without the frustration of trying to fit my brain into a rigid system.

Of course, you can just copy/paste these into Microsoft To-Do or whatever, but you do you.

But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Goblin Tools’ Compiler tool has also been a lifesaver. As someone who often finds themselves frozen and unable to get started when it gets too crazy busy, I struggle to put my thoughts into words. I just turn on the dictate button on my phone and start talking. The Compiler’s ability to take my jumbled ideas and turn them into a coherent plan is nothing short of magical.

And those are just a couple of the standout tools in the Goblin suite. The team has also developed applications for everything from task estimation to language tweaking to helping me avoid reading too much judgement from text that’s kinda suss. Each one is designed to be simple and not overwhelming with bells and whistles. It’s a refreshing break from what we find in typical productivity apps.

Trust me, Goblin Tools is worth the looksee. It’s not just a productivity hack for the neurodivergent – it’s a potential game-changer for anyone who needs a little help with focus and getting unstuck.

Your inner goblin will thank you.
