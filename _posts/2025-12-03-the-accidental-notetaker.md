Taking notes is easy. Making sense of them later? That’s the part that always broke me. I’m lying. Taking notes hurts my soul. I kinda hate it and telling myself to *embrace the suck* is not helpful.

I’ve tried everything: elaborate systems, minimalist systems, digital, analog, hybrid. Most collapsed under their own weight. The ones that didn’t still left me with a pile of fragments I never had the energy to reassemble.

*So many Moleskins. So much illegible scrawl. My handwriting has a very short best before date for interpretation. If you know, you know.*

Then, almost by accident, I stumbled on a workflow that actually worked. It wasn’t a new app, a revolutionary framework, or a productivity guru’s manifesto. It was a perspective shift in when and how I made sense of what I captured.

Here’s how it happened.

## **The Struggle Bus of Good Intentions**

For years, my note-taking was a mess. In meetings, I’d scribble in notebooks, type furiously in OneNote, or worse, try to structure things in real time and miss half the conversation. I’d walk out with pages of half-formed thoughts, more bullets than a John Wick movie, and arrows pointing God knows where. Worse was the sinking feeling that I’d just wasted an hour. I would never revisit the notes because they had no long-tail meaning.

I tried *everything*:

- **Apple Notes: The Comfortable Junk Drawer**  
  For a long time, this was my default. It still is. Fast, everywhere, Siri-friendly. A beautiful, searchable paradox, full of insights I could never find when I needed them. No structure, no guilt. Just… stuff. It scaled into chaos, not clarity.
- **The Forever Notes Framework**  
  I’m not alone. About a year ago, Matthias Hilse came up with a framework to tame Apple Notes for him and [shared it here](https://www.myforevernotes.com/). I admire the idea: atomic notes, linked thinking, a personal knowledge garden. The perpetual journal thing is chef’s kiss. It’s essentially a digital [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/). I tried. I really did. But it demands more upkeep than I can sustain. During busy stretches, it collapses into another graveyard of broken promises. I’m still using it for weekly and quarterly planning. That’s working well. *Take what resonates and discard the rest.*
- **Obsidian: The Fiddly Era Redux**  
  Plugins, backlinks, constant refactoring. It was like owning a high-maintenance sports car, I spent more time tuning it than driving it. Eventually, the friction outweighed the benefits. The two happiest days in a Jag owner’s life? The day they buy the car and the day they sell it. Obsidian is kinda like that. I promise to not try it again. Probably. [You can check out Obsidian here.](https://obsidian.md)
- **Plain Text (VS Code + Git)**  
  This is my writing studio. Solid, calm, durable. Version control without ceremony. I’ve always loved it for both blogging and long-form work. A folder tree brimming with simple text files has been with me for decades. But plain text isn’t built for meetings. It’s great for capture, terrible for sense-making. You cannot simultaneously listen to budget explanations and type out intricate markdown headers. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a great text editor. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a great place to keep your files safe, but not for everyone. Any cloud solution and backup strategy will do the job.
- **OneNote**  
  A sprawling, multi-layered maze that required more mental energy to organize than it returned. I use this for work by default because we’re a Microsoft shop and a bunch of people share OneNote notebooks. It integrates with the entire Office suite and I’m told it’s amazeballs by its adherents. I don’t see it. Not for me anyway. Something about floating textboxes on an infinite white canvas damages my calm. I have notes and notebooks in sections and pages everywhere. It’s horrid. And I hate it. [OneNote](https://onenote.cloud.microsoft/) is free for personal use.
- **Plaintext Productivity as a Philosophy**   
  I love me all the low-friction tools and open formats. Michael Descy has put together the best approach I’ve seen with [Plaintext Productivity](https://plaintext-productivity.net/). But even plain text doesn’t solve the core problem: *I could capture everything and still understand nothing.* Plaintext and markdown are language, but they are not tools.

So I kept searching.

## **Spoiler Alert! An AI Workflow**

A few months ago, I was testing [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) for something unrelated. On a whim, I opened it during a meeting and typed:

```
I’m in a meeting. Don’t respond unless I ask you to. Just capture facts, ideas, and actions as I share them.
```

No structure. No formatting. Just raw fragments.

I didn’t have to think about where to put things. I didn’t have to fight with bullet points or indentation. I just listened and talked in the meeting, tapped a few words, and stayed present.

Unlike paper, I didn’t have to retype anything later.

Unlike OneNote, I didn’t have to organize anything in real time.

It was the first time I’d ever captured notes *without* feeling like I was failing at note-taking.

Side note. You don’t have to do this in the chatbot live. Half the time, I just tapped into Notepad or an Apple Note. Doesn’t matter. Just capture the scraps.

## **The Sense-Making Pipeline**

Here’s where the magic happened, not during the meeting, but *after*.

### **Phase 1: Neutral Gap Review**

If needed, I copy/paste the raw notes into a clean chat. At the bottom of the capture, I say to Copilot:

```
Here’s what I captured. Identify gaps or unclear points, but don’t invent meaning. Ask me smart one at a time questions to fill in the blanks.
```

It would flag missing context, ambiguous phrases, or places where my shorthand was too cryptic. No hallucinations, no assumptions, just a neutral review. It would ask *me* to clarify when needed. Extract the stuff I heard but didn’t jot down.

What’s weird, is that I didn’t need a copy of the meeting transcript to do this.

### **Phase 2: Interrogate and Interview**

This was the game-changer.

Instead of staring at a wall of text, I’d ask Copilot:

```
What’s the most important decision we made?
What are the open questions?
What’s one thing I might have missed?
```

It forced me to clarify my own thinking, one piece at a time. No overwhelm, no rabbit holes, just a structured conversation that surfaced blind spots I’d glossed over.

### **Phase 3: Optional Riffing**

If I had bandwidth, time or a niggling interest that would not quiet, I’d ask:

```
What’s a creative way to approach [X]?
How might this connect to [Y]?
```

This isn’t about AI generating ideas for me. I use it as a sounding board to explore my own thoughts.

### **Phase 4: The Roll-Up Summary**

Once I’d clarified the key points, I’ll ask for a clean summary:

```
Give me a structured recap: decisions, actions, open questions.
```

No fluff, no filler. Just a distilled version of what actually mattered.

### **Phase 5: Publish to Loop**

It’s a trivial button click to push the output to a [Microsoft Loop](https://loop.cloud.microsoft) page, title it with the date and topic, and drop it into the appropriate workspace. No admin, no restructuring. Just a modular, shareable artifact.

## **Why This Actually Works**

### **1. Light Capture Preserves Presence**

I don’t fight note structure during meetings anymore. I just capture raw material.

### **2. Sense-Making Happens**

Post-meeting, when I have bandwidth, AI acts as a facilitator (not a replacement) for thinking. By shifting the organization and clarification effort to the post-meeting window, I utilize my available cognitive bandwidth.

### 3. Facilitated Thinking Wins

The one-question-at-a-time model surfaces gaps I’d otherwise miss. Facilitated thinking beats solo note cleanup. *That’s it. That’s the tweet.* Every time.

### **4. Fits My Existing Systems**

The fragments map naturally to any existing setup. No new frameworks, no extra steps. You can even dump it all into OneNote, *you monsters*.

### **5. Loop Finally Makes Sense**

It’s content-centric, not document-centric. Notes become modular, live objects—not static files gathering digital dust. Yeah, I think I’m starting to finally understand the paradigm shift Loop represents. *All the [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) users can slow-clap now.*

## **Who This Is For**

- **As a general rule, don’t put sensitive or confidential info into AI.** This is for personal sense-making, not classified discussions.
- **Works for:**

  - Faculty: curriculum planning, research discussions.
  - Students: clarifying lecture notes, brainstorming.
  - Anyone who’s tired of staring at a wall of text and wondering, *“What was I even thinking?”*
- **This complements, not replaces, official notes.** Use it alongside Teams Notes or meeting minutes.

## **Less Guilt, More Clarity**

I don’t dread reviewing my notes anymore. I don’t feel guilty about abandoned systems. I’m not “taking notes”. I’m co-authoring clarity with a tool that asks better questions than I do on my own.

It’s not perfect. It’s not for every situation. But for the first time in years, my note-taking system aligns with how I actually think. *Thankee sai.*

## **The Open Experiment**

I’m still exploring this. Testing reverse-conversation patterns, tweaking the prompts, seeing what else sticks.

If you’ve struggled with note-taking, try this for *one* meeting this week. See what happens. You might be surprised. I was.

**Do your future self a solid: one meeting, one workflow, zero chaos.**
