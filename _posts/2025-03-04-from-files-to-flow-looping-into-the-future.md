Let's be honest, how many times have you found yourself drowning in a sea of email attachments, desperately searching for the "final" version of a document? Or worse, trying to decipher a project update buried somewhere in an Excel spreadsheet that hasn't been touched since last Tuesday? I've been there. We've all been there. It's the document-centric nightmare we've come to accept as the status quo. But what if there was a better way?

## **The Pain Points: Where Did We Go Wrong?**

Think about how we typically work. We create documents, store them in folders (on our desktops, in the cloud, who knows where?), and then we share them via email. Sound familiar? It’s a digital version of the old paper-based office, complete with filing cabinets and interoffice memos. We've just replaced physical clutter with digital clutter. And let's be real, it's not much better.

Version control becomes a joke. "Final\_v2\_revised\_final\_final.docx" anyone? Collaborative editing turns into a game of "pin the tail on the document," with everyone trying to merge their changes without accidentally overwriting someone else's work. And project management? Don't even get me started. Excel spreadsheets become graveyards of outdated information, and project updates are communicated through cryptic emails that leave everyone confused

## **The Content-Centric Revolution: It's Not About Files, It's About Flow**

So, what's the alternative? It's a shift in mindset, a move away from focusing on static files and toward prioritizing content and flow. Instead of just managing files, we're managing *knowledge*. This is what we mean by "content-centric"—it's about working directly with the information itself, making it dynamic, accessible, and constantly evolving.

## **Enter Microsoft Loop and Planner: The Dynamic Duo**

This is where Microsoft Loop and Planner come in. Think of them as the dynamic duo of the content-centric revolution. Loop is your collaborative canvas, a place where teams can create and edit content together in real time. Forget about emailing attachments; with Loop, everyone works on the same living document, incorporating text, tables, lists, images – whatever you need – all within a single, shared space. It's a powerful new way to work.

[![](/assets/images/from-files-to-flow-looping-into-the-future/88ae2f51-0f5d-43f0-8768-cbdc62185ab6_2048x2048.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3sJy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F88ae2f51-0f5d-43f0-8768-cbdc62185ab6_2048x2048.jpeg)

**Planner** is your project management sidekick, bringing structure and organization to the collaborative chaos. You can assign tasks, set deadlines, track progress, and keep everyone on the same page (literally and figuratively). Imagine those faculty and instructors updating their curriculum. With Loop, they can co-create learning modules, incorporating feedback from colleagues as they go. And with Planner, they can manage the project, ensuring that everything stays on track and deadlines are met. It's like having a project manager and a creative director all rolled into one.

#### **Let's illustrate with a concrete example.**

Imagine the Business program instructors, as a Faculty Curriculum Working Group, updating their "Introduction to Marketing" course. They can use Loop to collaboratively develop new learning modules, embedding videos, interactive quizzes, and links to relevant industry articles. As they work, they can get real-time feedback from each other directly within the Loop workspace. Meanwhile, they can use Planner to break down the curriculum update project into smaller tasks, assigning responsibilities and setting deadlines. This integrated approach streamlines the entire process, ensuring that the course is updated efficiently and effectively. Once the modules are finalized in Loop, they can then be easily added to the Brightspace course shell for student access by linking to the Loop content.

## **The Perks: Why Should You Care?**

Why should you care about all this? Well, for starters, it'll make your life a whole lot easier. No more version control nightmares, no more endless email chains, no more deciphering cryptic project updates. Collaboration becomes seamless and dynamic, freeing you up to focus on the work that actually matters.

In higher education, this means more effective collaboration among faculty and staff, leading to improved curriculum development, better-planned projects, and ultimately, a higher quality learning experience for our students. It means we can work smarter, not harder, and respond more effectively to the needs of our community. Plus, Loop and Planner integrate seamlessly with other M365 tools like SharePoint and OneDrive, providing a unified and powerful collaborative environment.

a Planner plan can be a workspace component

## **Loop Workspaces vs. Components: A Quick Clarification**

A Loop *workspace* is the main container for your collaborative work. Think of it like a shared digital room where your team can come together. Inside the workspace, you'll find *components* – these are the individual elements you use to create and share content, like text blocks, lists, tables, images, and more.

TL;DR: A *workspace* contains pages and subpages. The pages themselves are made up of *components*.

Got it? Good.

## **Loop for Meetings: Streamlining Your Discussions**

Loop can also be a great tool for managing meetings. You can create a Loop workspace for a specific meeting, share the agenda beforehand, capture meeting minutes in real time, and assign action items directly within the workspace. This keeps all meeting-related information in one central location, making it easy to follow up and track progress.

When creating a New Meeting in the Teams calendar, at the bottom you'll spy *Add an agenda.* Click that.
