Technology is an integral part of our lives. How we use and learn from it varies depending on our level of digital fluency. Digital fluency is choosing and using the best digital tools to get the job done. It goes beyond the bells, whistles, knobs and dials of software. What matters is communicating, creating, learning and working in a digital environment.

Digital fluency has three main components: digital literacy, digital currency and digital wellbeing.

- **Digital literacy** is about foundational skills. It is how we use technology to create, discover and communicate.
- **Digital currency**is the knobs and dials. It is how to use specific features of software and platforms.
- **Digital wellbeing** is awareness and practice. It is how we use technology in a healthy and sustainable way. This includes:

  - **digital hygiene**: protecting privacy, data and devices from cyber threats.
  - **digital balance**: managing screen time, online stress, and mental wellness.

These three components of digital fluency are essential to thrive in the digital age. This can resonate for all learners, staff and faculty. As teachers and learners, we need to use technology to enhance outcomes. We need to keep up with trends and innovations in our fields. And we must maintain our social, mental and physical health in the face of constant stimuli.

## Aside: Digital Natives & Immigrants

No one has the same level of digital fluency. This creates challenges and inequalities in the digital world. Back in 2001, Marc Prensky popularized the digital native/immigrant model.

- **Digital natives** are those who were born after the advent of digital technology. They are more comfortable and proficient.
- **Digital immigrants** are those who were born before and have to adapt and learn.

In 2024, most of us have figured out this model doesn’t hold water. It’s probably inaccurate, certainly simplistic and possibly harmful.

- **It is stereotyping.** Like generational theory, what is the magic age cutoff? There is no real proof that age alone determines digital fluency. Other factors such as education, income, gender, culture and motivation play significant roles.
- **It is a false dichotomy, even discriminatory.** It posits that one group is superior and more advanced than the other. This creates alienation, resentment, arrogance and entitlement. This hinders rather than helps.
- **It is risky and promotes complacency.**Digital natives are not somehow more capable and savvy with technology. We all need guidance and support to be safe and effective. Digital technology evolves. That’s it. That’s the tweet. Everyone needs to develop and update their digital fluency skills. Everyone needs to be aware and responsible for their digital wellbeing.

## Anyway…

We can take a nuanced and holistic perspective. We can recognize the diversity and complexity of digital fluency. And we can promote a culture of lifelong learning and digital citizenship.

Here is how we do it:

- **Adopt a growth mindset and a curiosity for learning.** Don’t view digital fluency as a fixed trait that depends on age or background. It is a dynamic skill that we develop and improve through practice and feedback. We stay open and eager to learn new things. We explore all the new possibilities that technology offers. We resist fear.
- **Seek and provide mentorship and collaboration.** There are no digital immigrants and natives. We are all digital learners and digital mentors. We seek and provide opportunities through our diverse perspectives. We leverage our individual and collective strengths.
- **Balance and optimize our digital use for wellbeing.** Don’t become consumed and overwhelmed by technology. We must be mindful and intentional about how we use it and how it affects us. We should set and follow a healthy digital balance through practice. Set boundaries. Digital technology is a tool to enhance our wellbeing, not to harm it.

As a community of digital citizens, we have a responsibility and an opportunity. We foster this approach for ourselves and for our students. And we prepare ourselves and them for the future of work and life in the digital age.
