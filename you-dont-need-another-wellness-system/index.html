      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>I am messy. My to-do list <em>still</em> lives across three apps, two notebooks, and way too many sticky notes. I eat lunch in frint of a screen more often than I should. I check my phone when I said I wouldn’t. And right now, during NSCC Wellness Week, I’m writing a blog post about wellness while definitely not feeling “well.”</p>

<p>So let me be clear: this isn’t another wellness system.</p>

<p>It’s late January 2026. We’re buried in snow. It’s effing cold. Trump is being Trumpish, wars are grinding on, trade chaos is everywhere, and human rights are taking a beating south of the border. Money is tight. Students are struggling. Staff are stretched thin. Nobody I know is truly thriving right now. Most of us are just surviving, and even that feels like work some days. The hits keep coming, and the mental wellness toll is real.</p>

<p>And here comes Wellness Week. Which I love. But I’m tired.</p>

<p>I appreciate the intention. But for a lot of people, Wellness Week can feel like another obligation. Another thing on the list when you’re already drowning. Another reminder that you’re supposed to be optimizing your habits, tracking your steps, journaling your gratitude, and somehow emerging as a perfectly balanced human being.</p>

<p>Wellness culture has become optimization culture. Optimization culture is exhausting.</p>

<p>So I want to say this instead: <strong>Being okay ain’t religion.</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-that-actually-means">What That Actually Means</h2>

<p>When I say “being okay ain’t religion,” I mean wellness doesn’t require devotion. It doesn’t demand perfection. You don’t need to be a faithful follower of some five-step program or match the routine of your favorite productivity YouTuber. You don’t need to track, measure, or gamify your way to some imaginary finish line.</p>

<p>Being okay is a state, not an achievement. You’re allowed to just… be okay. That’s enough.</p>

<p>Wellness culture doesn’t tell you that. Instead, it tells you that if you’re not optimized, you’re failing. If you’re not hitting your macros, meditating daily, and maintaining inbox zero, you’re somehow doing life wrong. Social media is full of people with perfect morning routines and colour-coded planners, and if you can’t keep up, well, that’s on you.</p>

<p>If your wellness plan makes you feel worse about yourself, you’re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>You’re trading the work hamster wheel for the wellness hamster wheel. Same exhausting sprint, different scenery. Stop optimizing your habits like life is a spreadsheet. Perfection isn’t the game.</p>

<p>Wellness is a by-product. It’s what happens when you listen to your body, your mind, your soul, not someone else’s routine. It’s what shows up when you set a few sane boundaries and give yourself permission to just be human.</p>

<p>Can’t be on vacation in Cancun? A walk in the snow and a decent lunch is enough. Being okay is enough. Grace over judgment, for yourself, for others. People do the best they can at any given moment. Even you.</p>

<p>So what actually helps? If you only do one thing this week, do this.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-thing-disconnect-from-the-news-cycle">The One Thing: Disconnect from the News Cycle</h2>

<p>If you’re barely keeping your head above water, this one move might actually give you some breathing room. <strong>Disconnect from the news cycle and social media.</strong> Just for a bit. Not forever. Just this week. Try it for the rest of Wellness Week and see how you feel.</p>

<p>I know that sounds impossible. But here’s the tactical version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delete Twitter/X. Delete your news reader app. Whatever pulls you into the doom spiral, remove it from your phone.</li>
  <li>Turn off push notifications for news sites in your browser. All of them.</li>
  <li>Unfollow the political accounts. Yes, even the ones you agree with. Especially those.</li>
  <li>If you absolutely must check in, set a timer. Fifteen minutes max. Then close it and walk away.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not pretending this is easy. These platforms are addictive by design. They’re built to keep you scrolling, to keep you anxious, to keep you coming back for the next hit of outrage or despair. Stepping back feels hard because it is hard.</p>

<p>Bad news will always find you. There is no duty to stay hyperinformed. You’re not failing by stepping back. There’s no requirement to be up-to-date on every terrible thing happening in the world. You don’t have to “do your part” by doomscrolling at midnight. Being informed does not mean being constantly plugged in.</p>

<p>Most of this is beyond your control anyway. I get the urge to stay informed. It feels like staying engaged, like being a responsible citizen. But scrolling doesn’t change Trump. It doesn’t stop wars. It doesn’t fix trade policy. What it does is drain your mental battery and leave you too exhausted to deal with the things you <em>can</em> actually control.</p>

<p>Your mental health is one of those things. Focus there.</p>

<p>If you can manage more than one thing this week, here are three boundaries that might help. <strong>But pick one. You don’t have to do all three.</strong></p>

<h2 id="three-boundaries-that-actually-help">Three Boundaries That Actually Help</h2>

<p>These are boundaries. Defense mechanisms. Ways to contain the chaos. <strong>Pick one that feels doable. That’s enough.</strong></p>

<h3 id="boundary-1-turn-off-notifications">Boundary 1: Turn Off Notifications</h3>

<p>Do this immediately. If you already turned off news alerts, apply that same principle to everything else except actual humans trying to reach you. Dings, beeps, red splotches on app icons, all of it, gone. Yes, even work notifications. If your job truly requires immediate response to every ping, keep those. Otherwise, off.</p>

<p>You’ll check your phone anyway. Four times an hour, ten times an hour, that’s still better than being interrupted. Make it intentional instead of reactive. This is self-defense. You’re not ignoring people, you’re protecting your attention.</p>

<p>Next level: delete social media apps from your phone. Use browser versions if you must. Friction is your friend. Opening a browser and typing a URL is just enough hassle to make you pause and ask, “Do I actually want to do this right now?” That tiny bit of friction matters.</p>

<h3 id="boundary-2-emailteamscommunication-chaos-stays-in-its-lane">Boundary 2: Email/Teams/Communication Chaos Stays in Its Lane</h3>

<p>Email is fake productivity. So is Teams. So is Discord, Slack, or whatever your communication chaos happens to be. Playing whack-a-mole with messages makes you feel busy, but it steals time from your actual work. Whether you’re a student juggling Discord servers or staff drowning in Outlook, same principle applies. <strong>It’s someone else’s to-do list, not yours.</strong></p>

<p>Check it once or twice a day, scheduled. Then close the app. Like walking away from your mailbox. You don’t stare at your mailbox all day waiting for the mail carrier to show up. Same logic.</p>

<p>Now, I know some of you have bosses or faculty who expect immediate responses. That’s a real constraint. What you CAN control: when you check outside those urgent windows. If you’re not in crisis-response mode, batch your communication. Process it, respond to what needs responding, then close it and do your actual work.</p>

<p>When tasks show up in your messages, write them down. Grab a 3x5 notebook or a sticky note. Analog for the day. Paper and pen will do you good. Capture the task, close the app, go do the work.</p>

<p>Treat communication like physical mail: process it, file or shred it, move on.</p>

<p><strong>Note for leaders and managers:</strong> Stop sending emails at 9 PM. I don’t care if you’re “just clearing your head.” You’re modeling terrible boundaries. Use delay-send. Your team will thank you.</p>

<h3 id="boundary-3-take-your-damn-lunch">Boundary 3: Take Your Damn Lunch</h3>

<p>Schedule lunch on your calendar. Actually leave your desk. Eat a sandwich, touch snow, make a snowball, think about something else for a minute. <strong>The most radical wellness hack = eating lunch without your laptop open.</strong></p>

<p>You don’t need to care about the science, you just need permission to step away. But if you do care: your brain runs on energy cycles, roughly 90 minutes each. Each cycle depletes you if you don’t break. Lunch resets the system. You get fresh energy for the afternoon instead of running on fumes.</p>

<p>Don’t doomscroll TikTok during lunch. That’s trading one stress for another. Don’t eat at your desk while working. Don’t skip lunch because you’re “too busy.” You’re not too busy. You’re scared that if you stop, you’ll fall behind. You won’t. You’ll just be less fried.</p>

<p>Take micro-breaks too. Every 90 minutes, stand up, hydrate, blink, look out a window. And at the end of your day, close your laptop, tidy your desk, and walk away. Actually walk away.</p>

<h2 id="optional-the-3-wins-practice">Optional: The 3 Wins Practice</h2>

<p><strong>THIS IS OPTIONAL.</strong> Seriously. Skip this if you want. I mean it.</p>

<p>If you want something to help you feel grounded (emphasis on <em>if</em>), here’s a practice I use kinda regularly, messily, imperfectly. It’s not required. It’s just something that helps me, and maybe it’ll help you.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, ask yourself: “If this were Friday, what three outcomes would make this week feel good?” Not tasks. Outcomes. What needles would you like to move? Write them on a sticky note and stick it on your monitor.</p>

<p>On Friday, reflect: “What did I learn this week? What would I change?” That’s it. Two questions. Low friction.</p>

<p><strong>Or don’t.</strong> This is optional.</p>

<p>If one of your three outcomes is “survive,” that counts. Checkmark, you survived. Sometimes that’s the best you can do. Macro or micro, doesn’t matter. Finish the outline for a big report? Great. Help three people this week? Also great. Gratitude forward and backward helps mental wellness, and there’s nothing better for your soul than helping another person.</p>

<p>People do the best they can at any given moment. Grace over judgment, for yourself, for others.</p>

<h2 id="permission-to-be-okay">Permission to Be Okay</h2>

<p>You don’t need another wellness system. Being okay is enough. I’m going to say that again: <strong>being okay is enough.</strong></p>

<p>Listen to your body, your mind, your soul. Not someone else’s routine. Not influencer standards. Not the optimized version of yourself that exists only in your head. You’re allowed to just be okay.</p>

<p>Try one thing this week. Just one. Disconnect from the news if nothing else. Or turn off notifications. Or take your damn lunch. <strong>You don’t have to do all three. One is enough.</strong> If you try something and it doesn’t work, that’s okay too. You’re not failing. You’re learning what works for you.</p>

<p>Get offline. Be around humans. Touch grass, or snow, because it’s January and there’s a lot of snow. Stop giving Trump mental real estate for five minutes. The biggest antidote to all of this: disconnect from screens, engage with the humans around you.</p>

<p>This is Wellness Week. Don’t let it be another obligation. Let it be permission instead. Permission to step back. Permission to be okay. Permission to survive.</p>

<p>That’s wellness too.</p>

<p>Be messy. Be okay. That’s enough.</p>
